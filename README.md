# ng-routing

Example app for [Deborah Kurata's](https://github.com/DeborahK) Angular Routing course on [PluralSight](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/angular-routing). Except I reworked the set up to use ng cli because the initial dev environment was a bit weird. The course is OK. It's taught with an AngularJS _state_ of mind, which is a bit gross. (Emphasis added to make the pun more apparent).
